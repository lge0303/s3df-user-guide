# üîë How to Access S3DF

S3DF supports three main access methods depending on your needs: terminal (SSH), remote desktop (NoMachine), and browser-based access (OnDemand). Below is a breakdown of each option:


## 1. üñ•Ô∏è SSH (Terminal Access)

If you're comfortable using a terminal, SSH is the most direct way to access S3DF.

- Use any SSH client such as:

  - macOS/Linux: Built-in terminal with ssh

  - Windows: PuTTY or Windows Terminal with OpenSSH

- Connect to the S3DF login pool using this command:

     ssh your_username@s3dflogin.slac.stanford.edu

- These login nodes are bastion hosts and only give access to your home directory.

- To use storage or run compute jobs, you‚Äôll need to SSH again from the login node to an interactive compute node.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Users:
If you see an error like:

    Corrupted MAC on input or message authentication code incorrect
    
try adding this flag to your SSH command:

    ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 your_username@s3dflogin.slac.stanford.edu

‚úÖ Example 2: Login via S3DF OnDemand (Web Portal)

Scenario: You want to access S3DF through your browser (no command line required).

Open this link in your browser:

https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu

Click "Login" in the upper right.

Enter your SLAC credentials.

After login, you can:

Launch a Shell Terminal

Start a Jupyter Notebook

Open a Remote Desktop

View and manage jobs, storage, and more

üí° The OnDemand portal is beginner-friendly and does not require software installation.

‚úÖ Optional: Use NoMachine (Graphical Remote Desktop)

Scenario: You want a persistent graphical desktop session.

Download and install the NoMachine client for your platform.

Connect to:

s3dfnx.slac.stanford.edu

Benefits:

Better performance for graphical/X11 apps over slow networks

Sessions persist across disconnections
